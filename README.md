Visual imagery has been largely neglected within music psychology research despite its importance
for understanding music-evoked emotions[1]. In relation to music, visual mental imagery refers
to the mechanism through which music evokes internal images in the listener.[2]
Large areas still remain almost unexplored, one of them being the correlation of emotion and
visual imagery. Research suggests that mental imagery and emotional processes during music
listening are closely intertwined[1], causing us to ask the following questions:

• Does the type of emotion matter?

• Does emotion come before imagery or do they occur at the same time?

• Are imagery and emotion always connected in the same way?
