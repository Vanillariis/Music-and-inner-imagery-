# Music and Inner Imagery 

## Background 

In relation to music, visual mental imagery refers to the mechanism whereby music stimulates internal images in the listener consisting of pictorial representations (e.g., natural land- scape or colors), 
embodied image schemata (e.g., picturing a melodic movement as an ascending or descending image), or complex visual narratives (e.g., similar to that of a movie).([Taruffi et al. 2017][1]) 
In the the theoretical framework proposed by Juslin and Västfjäll six mechanisms are identified as through which music listening evokes emotions and moods, one of them being visual imagery.([Juslin et al, 2008][2]) 
However, visual imagery have been largely neglected by music psychology research despite their crucial role in music-evoked emotions ([Day et al., 2019][3] [Vuoskoski et al, 2015][4]). [Taruffi et al. 2017][5] observed that spontaneous thoughts occur more significantly in the form of images compared with words during both sad and happy music. 

Does emotion function as a mediating mechanism between music and images? 

## Hypothosis 
H1: Sad music will generate imagery before the emotion. 
H2: Happy music will generate the emothion and then imagery.
