The background also became clearer, it was a natural landscape, old ruins, and the sun coming through the clouds (maybe connected to the questions from earlier?). I started feeling a bit scared, like something was ending. (2) Then we started dancing. It reminded me of Swan Lake. The background was different, but we all stayed in the same emotional state. I felt this strong longing for something. I could see that feeling on my own face and on my friend’s too. It got quite sad, and at some point I closed my eyes while dancing.
