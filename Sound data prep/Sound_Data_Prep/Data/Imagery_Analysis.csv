P23,sad,"(1) While listening, I slowly started seeing a crowd of people appear. Everyone felt very in their own head, kind of present but not really there. The background also became clearer, it was a natural landscape, old ruins, and the sun coming through the clouds (maybe connected to the questions from earlier?). I started feeling a bit scared, like something was ending. (2) Then we started dancing. It reminded me of Swan Lake. The background was different, but we all stayed in the same emotional state. I felt this strong longing for something. I could see that feeling on my own face and on my friend’s too. It got quite sad, and at some point I closed my eyes while dancing. (3) I started imagining moments from the past, but only for a bit, because the music stopped.","People that are not really present, natural landscapes, old ruins, sun, dancing, scared something is ending"
